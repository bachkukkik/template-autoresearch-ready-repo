"""Unit tier — the output-medium doctrine's own tripwire. IDs: AC-OM-0NN.

Hermetic: a handful of file reads and the stdlib only — no subprocess, no service
import, no transport. The subjects of these tests are tracked documents (the standing
order in AGENTS.md, the immutable raw source, the kb concept page and its index), not
the example service.

Each AC pinpoints a claim the PRD (docs/prd/13-output-medium-doctrine.md) makes about
the doctrine, so a drift in any one of the three layers it spans — the instruction
file, stage-2 raw knowledge, stage-3 confirmed knowledge — turns red here.
