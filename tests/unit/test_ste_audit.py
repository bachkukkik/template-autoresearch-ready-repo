"""Unit tier — the STE-style audit tripwire. IDs: AC-STE-0NN (docs/prd/15-ste-audit.md).

Hermetic: the auditor is loaded by path and driven in-process with main(argv) — no
subprocess, no service import, no transport. AC-STE-001 asserts the repo's real docs
stay above the 80% floor; AC-STE-002 proves the auditor discriminates (and that fenced
code is exempt); AC-STE-003 pins the CLI contract.
