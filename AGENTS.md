# Agent Instructions — template-autoresearch-ready-repo

> **This file is the single source of agent instructions for every harness.**
> `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are **symlinks** to this file —
> edit `AGENTS.md` only. Repo-scoped skills and plugins live in `.agents/`, with each
> harness's own directory symlinked to it. See *Harness Adapter* below.

## What This Is

A template repo for **autonomous research** in the style of
[karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), built on the
**bachkukkik/template-agentic-ready-repo doctrine**: the same document funnel,
harness adapter, and PRD→SC→test→CI gates, applied to the research loop pattern
(`program.md`/`train.py`/`prepare.py`, fixed-time budget, keep/discard).

**Current state:** the `kb/` knowledge base is populated (2026-09-04) with
ingested raw sources (upstream `program.md`, 11 YouTube transcripts, research
conclusions) and the synthesized layer-2 pages. Agents working in this repo
should orient in `kb/` first (see *Read First*), then follow the funnel below
for any new writing.

## Read First

1. *Document Funnel* below — where any piece of writing is allowed to live. Read before writing anything.
2. `PRD.md` — master product requirements index → topic PRDs in `docs/prd/`
3. `docs/README.md` — verdict catalog for the empirical layer → `docs/NN-slug.md` (what actually works / fails). See *Planned vs Working* below.
4. `kb/index.md` — knowledge base catalog (canonical semantics, architecture, data models, decisions)
5. `README.md` — quick start, services, development commands

> **Three indexes, three layers, no overlap:** `kb/index.md` catalogs knowledge (stage 3),
> `PRD.md` catalogs intent (stage 4), `docs/README.md` catalogs verified reality (stage 6).
> Same `NN` number for one topic across `docs/prd/`, `docs/gaps/`, and `docs/`.

> **Source-of-truth doctrine (from PRD.md):** KB wins on semantics/behaviour; repo artifacts win on literal values; top-level PRD wins over detail PRDs.

> **Planned vs Working doctrine:** `docs/prd/` states *intent* (what we plan to build); `docs/NN-slug.md` records *verified reality* (what works, what fails, the net verdict). When the two diverge, the PRD wins on intent and the NN doc wins on behaviour. Every substantive change MUST consult the relevant NN doc and update it via the `coding-agents-docs-guideline` skill — never edit `docs/NN-slug.md` without that skill loaded.

---

## Document Funnel (MANDATORY — every harness, every agent)

Writing flows in **one direction only**. Each stage narrows and hardens what the stage
above it produced. Every agent MUST know which stage its output belongs to *before*
writing, and MUST NOT skip a stage.

| # | Stage | Path | Contains | Mutability | Written with |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 0 | Prompt | — | User's desire and imagination, any harness | ephemeral | — |
| 1 | Scratch | `scratchpads/` | Playgrounds, quick notes, memos, throwaway analysis | free-for-all; **gitignored, deletable at any time** | any tool |
| 2 | Raw knowledge | `kb/raw/` | Immutable source documents about the project — any format (articles, papers, transcripts, assets) | **add new files or archive; never edit in place** | manual capture / ingest |
| 3 | Knowledge | `kb/` (`concepts/`, `entities/`, `comparisons/`, `queries/`, `index.md`, `log.md`) | Confirmed knowledge, synthesized and fitted to repo purpose | agent-owned; regenerated from `kb/raw/` | **`llm-wiki` on `./kb/` only** |
| 4 | Intent | `PRD.md`, `docs/prd/NN-*.md` | Requirements, success criteria, test mapping, CI gate | edit freely, must stay grounded in `kb/` | PRD skills (see mapping) |
| 5 | Gaps | `docs/gaps/NN-*.md` | Observed divergence: kb ↔ prd, or prd ↔ codebase | short-lived; closed when resolved | `karpathy-guidelines` |
| 6 | Reality | `docs/NN-slug.md` + `docs/README.md` | Empirical observation — What/Why/How/Verification/What Works/What Fails/Resolution/Verdict; `README.md` is the verdict catalog | append/update per verified run | **`coding-agents-docs-guideline` only** |
| 7 | Everything else | GitHub issues | Anything that fits no stage above | issue thread | `gh` CLI |

### Funnel rules

1. **No stray documents.** A new `.md` outside stages 1–6 is a defect. No `NOTES.md`,
   no `TODO.md`, no `ANALYSIS.md` at repo root. If it fits no stage, it is an
   **issue** — file one, or comment on the existing one.
2. **Grounding direction is downward.** A stage may only assert what an upstream stage
   supports. A PRD claim with no `kb/` backing is `[ASSUMPTION]`-marked or dropped. A
   `docs/NN-slug.md` claim with no verification command is not a claim.
3. **`kb/raw/` is append-or-archive.** Never rewrite a raw source. Superseded raw files
   move to `kb/_archive/` preserving their path. Enforced in CI by
   `.github/workflows/sources-readonly.yml`.
4. **`kb/` layer-2 pages are never hand-written.** Update `kb/raw/`, then run the
   `llm-wiki` skill against `./kb/`. Follow the llm-wiki spec strictly:
   <https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/skills/research/llm-wiki/SKILL.md>
   Vendor the exact revision you pin to at `.agents/skills/llm-wiki/SKILL.md`.
5. **Unused knowledge is archived, not deleted.** `kb/_archive/` is the terminus for
   stage 2 and 3 material — remove from `index.md`, replace inbound wikilinks with
   plain text + "(archived)", log the action in `kb/log.md`.
6. **`scratchpads/` is never cited.** No tracked document may reference a scratchpad
   path as evidence — promote the content to `kb/raw/` first.
7. **Gaps are transient.** A `docs/gaps/` file closes by producing one of: a `kb/raw/`
   ingest, a PRD edit, a code change with tests, or an issue. State which in its
   *Resolution* section, then it may be archived out of the repo.
8. **Skill gates are absolute.** Stage 3 requires `llm-wiki`; stage 6 requires
   `coding-agents-docs-guideline`. No harness mechanism for a skill = paste its
   `SKILL.md` into the prompt and follow it manually. A missing tool never waives the gate.
9. **Never write a secret into `kb/` or `docs/`.** Both are tracked. `kb/raw/` is the
   ingest target for exactly the material that carries live values — vendor webhook
   specs, API setup pages, deployment runbooks — so a verbatim paste is the likely way
   a credential enters this repo. Record *that a secret exists and where it is
   configured* (`.env` var name, `.credentials/` filename), never its value. Redact
   before ingest, not after: `kb/raw/` is add-only, so a leaked secret cannot be edited
   out — it costs a rotation plus an archive. Enforced in CI by the `secret-scan` job.
10. **The doctrine itself is tracked.** `AGENTS.md`, `PRD.md`, `docs/`, `kb/`, `tests/`,
   `.agents/`, `.github/` and the harness symlinks are versioned artifacts, not local
   scaffolding. A `.gitignore` entry that hides any of them empties the funnel for every
   agent working from a fresh clone. Enforced by the `doctrine` job in
   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Where does this text go?

| If the writing is… | It goes to |
|---|---|
| A hunch, a scratch calculation, a paste buffer | `scratchpads/` |
| An external doc / spec / transcript that describes the project | `kb/raw/` |
| A stable fact about how this project works | `kb/raw/` → `llm-wiki ./kb/` |
| A thing we want to build | `docs/prd/` |
| "The PRD says X but the code does Y" | `docs/gaps/` |
| "I ran it; here is what worked and what failed" | `docs/NN-slug.md` |
| A bug, a question, a decision to revisit | GitHub issue / issue comment |

## Harness Adapter

This repo is harness-neutral. It is written against **capabilities**, not against any
one agent product. Every rule below names a capability; each harness supplies its own
mechanism. If your harness lacks a mechanism, perform the capability manually — a
missing tool never waives the rule.

| Capability | Hermes | Claude Code | Copilot / other | Generic fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Entry instruction file | `AGENTS.md` (native) | `CLAUDE.md` (symlink) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (symlink) | read `AGENTS.md` manually |
| Repo-scoped skills / plugins | `.agents/skills`, `.agents/plugins` | same, via `.claude/skills`, `.claude/plugins` symlinks | symlink the vendor dir to `.agents/` | inline the skill's `SKILL.md` into the prompt |
| Host-level skills | `~/.hermes/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` | vendor-specific | — |
| Sub-agent delegation | `delegate_task` / `kanban` | `Task` tool sub-agents (`.claude/agents/`) | vendor-specific | do the work inline, in the documented phase order |
| Plan scratch space | `~/.hermes/plans/*.md` | `scratchpads/` (gitignored) | `scratchpads/` | `scratchpads/` |
| Pipeline invocation | `/goal <request>` | prompt the phases below in order | prompt the phases below in order | prompt the phases below in order |
| KB synthesis (funnel stage 3) | `/llm-wiki ./kb/` (native skill) | invoke `llm-wiki` skill on `./kb/` | invoke `llm-wiki` skill on `./kb/` | inline `.agents/skills/llm-wiki/SKILL.md`, apply its workflow to `./kb/` by hand |
| Issue tracking (funnel stage 7) | `gh issue create` / `gh issue comment` | same | same | same |

**Two symlink families, both pointing at one canonical source.**

Instruction entry points — every one resolves to `AGENTS.md`:

```
CLAUDE.md                        -> AGENTS.md
.github/copilot-instructions.md  -> ../AGENTS.md
```

Skill/plugin roots — `.agents/` is canonical, harness dirs point into it:

```
.agents/skills/                  # canonical, tracked
.agents/plugins/                 # canonical, tracked
.claude/skills                   -> ../.agents/skills
.claude/plugins                  -> ../.agents/plugins
```

Adding a harness = two symlinks (`ln -s AGENTS.md <entry-file>` and
`ln -s ../.agents/skills <vendor-dir>/skills`) plus a row in the table above.
Never fork the content, never duplicate a skill per harness.

Repo-scoped skills in `.agents/` are for skills this project pins. Everything the
README lists installs at **host** level by default — vendor into `.agents/skills/`
only when the version must travel with the repo. What this template ships pinned, and
what a project typically adds:

| Vendored skill | Why pinned here |
|---|---|
| `root-cause` | The root-cause gate below depends on its exact procedure |
| `llm-wiki` *(add per project)* | Funnel stage 3 is gated on it; `kb/` is built to one revision |
| domain skills *(add per project)* | Encode gotchas specific to this repo's stack |

`.claude/agents/investigator.md` is the Claude Code binding of the *root-cause gate*:
a read-only sub-agent that answers "why does X fail / what does X require" from cited
repo evidence (`kb/`, `docs/`, code, config) and returns an explicit "not found"
instead of a guess. Harnesses without sub-agents run the same procedure inline from
`.agents/skills/root-cause/SKILL.md`.

---

## The `/goal` Orchestration Workflow (coding-agent entry point)

Every substantive request is driven through the `/goal` pipeline. The coding agent MUST capture and follow this sequence.

**Kickoff prompt:**

```
/goal <whatever user request>

use pm skills for PRD, problem triage, success criteria definition and verification policy
use karpathy skill for codebase investigation and all resource analysis
prioritize task delegation over direct execution
use opencode-plan-build-orchestrator skill for all coding tasks
```

**Subsequent prompts (run in order):**

```
## sub1 — docs/tests gap sync
check gaps in docs/ and tests/ against codebase. update + drop obsolescences accordingly.

use pm skills for PRD, problem triage, success criteria definition and verification policy.
use karpathy skill for codebase investigation and all resource analysis.
prioritize task delegation over direct execution.
use opencode-plan-build-orchestrator skill for all coding tasks.

## sub2 — local CI
run github action locally using https://github.com/nektos/act

if problems surface, use pm skills for PRD, problem triage, success criteria definition and verification policy.
use karpathy skill for codebase investigation and all resource analysis.
prioritize task delegation over direct execution.
use opencode-plan-build-orchestrator skill for all coding tasks.

## sub3 — PR + CI monitor
PR using yeet. thoroughly provide context in the PR using coding agent docs skill. lastly monitor CI/CD in PR.

if problems surface, use pm skills for PRD, problem triage, success criteria definition and verification policy.
use karpathy skill for codebase investigation and all resource analysis.
prioritize task delegation over direct execution.
use opencode-plan-build-orchestrator skill for all coding tasks.

## sub4 — merge + redeploy
squash and merge to main all test-passed PRs.
then git checkout main and pull here.
lastly do full redeployment cycle from pull to serve.

use pm skills for PRD, problem triage, success criteria definition and verification policy.
use karpathy skill for codebase investigation and all resource analysis.
prioritize task delegation over direct execution.
use opencode-plan-build-orchestrator skill for all coding tasks.
```

### Running the pipeline without `/goal`

`/goal` is a Hermes slash command. Harnesses that lack it run the **same** pipeline by
prompting the phases in order — the `sub1`–`sub4` labels are the cross-harness contract,
so **"go through sub1-4"** is a valid instruction everywhere. Paste the blocks above
verbatim (drop the `/goal` line), or work from this table:

| # | Phase | Do | Done when |
|---|-------|----|-----------|
| kickoff | Triage | Triage the request, ingest any new source material to `kb/raw/` + run `llm-wiki ./kb/`, write/refresh the PRD section grounded in `kb/`, define success criteria + verification policy | SC list exists with `_Verify:_` annotations, each traceable to a `kb/` page |
| `sub1` | Docs/tests gap sync | Diff `kb/` ↔ `docs/prd/` ↔ codebase ↔ `tests/`; record divergences in `docs/gaps/`, update, and drop obsolescences | No SC without a test; no doc claiming behaviour the code lacks; every `docs/gaps/` file has a Resolution |
| `sub2` | Local CI | Run the workflows locally with [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) — `-j unit`, `-j integration`, `-j secret-scan`, `-j doctrine`; E2E runs directly, not under act (see §6) | those four jobs green + `bash tests/run.sh --with-e2e` green |
| `sub3` | PR + CI monitor | Open the PR with full context in the body; watch remote CI to completion | Remote CI green |
| `sub4` | Merge + redeploy | Squash-merge green PRs, `git checkout main && git pull`, run the full redeploy cycle | Service healthy from a clean pull |

Report each phase's *Done when* before starting the next. If a phase surfaces a problem,
re-enter kickoff triage for that problem before continuing.

**Skill-to-phase mapping** (install per README; substitute equivalents your harness ships):

| Phase | Skill | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Knowledge synthesis (funnel stage 3) | `llm-wiki` on `./kb/` | `kb/` layer-2 pages + `index.md` + `log.md` |
| PRD / triage / success criteria / verification policy | `pm` skills — `create-prd`, `identify-assumptions-*`, `test-scenarios` | `PRD.md` + `docs/prd/NN-*.md` |
| Codebase & resource investigation | `karpathy-guidelines` | Evidence-based gap report → `docs/gaps/NN-*.md` |
| Root-cause / requirement questions | `root-cause` (Claude Code: `investigator` sub-agent) | Cited answer, or explicit "not found" |
| Empirical doc authoring (planned vs working) | `coding-agents-docs-guideline` | `docs/NN-slug.md` |
| Task delegation | harness delegation mechanism (see adapter table) | Scoped sub-agent tasks |
| All coding | `opencode-plan-build-orchestrator` | plan → build → verify via subagents |

---

## Standing Orders (ALWAYS apply)

These rules apply to **every session, every agent, every prompt**.

### 1. Mandated Skills

Load and use these skills on EVERY task:

| Skill | When | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `karpathy-guidelines` | ALWAYS | Research context, clean code, surface assumptions |
| `security-best-practices` | ALWAYS | All code changes must follow security best practices |
| `webapp-testing` | Testing | Write and run comprehensive tests |
| `coding-agents-docs-guideline` | Docs | Author/edit `docs/NN-slug.md` — funnel stage 6. Required, no exceptions |
| `llm-wiki` | KB | Synthesize `kb/` from `kb/raw/` — funnel stage 3. The ONLY writer of `kb/` layer-2 pages |
| `root-cause` | Any "why does X fail / what does X require" question | Cited evidence before a cause is proposed. Never present a guess as a fact |
| `yeet` | Git ops | All commit/push/branch operations |
| `opencode-plan-build-orchestrator` | Coding via delegate | All coding tasks MUST route through plan→build→verify |

### 2. Delegation Rules (coding discipline)

- **Every delegated coding task MUST include** `opencode-plan-build-orchestrator` and `karpathy-guidelines` in the subagent's goal context — whatever the harness calls its delegation mechanism (see adapter table).
- **The orchestrator parent NEVER writes repo-tracked files directly** — all code edits go to subagents. Investigation, planning, PRD authoring, and plan scratch files stay with the parent.
- For docs-only tasks, the parent does the edits directly.
- **If the harness has no delegation mechanism**, the parent does the coding itself but still runs plan → build → verify as three distinct, separately-reported steps.

### 3. Code Quality Rules

- **No `shell=True`** in subprocess calls — use `subprocess.run` with explicit args
- **No hardcoded secrets** — credentials load from `.env` / a gitignored credentials
  directory, never inline
- **No `requests` without timeout** — always set `timeout=N`
- **Never log a credential** — not a token, not a signing secret, not a signature header
- **Never commit a credential to a doc** — `kb/` and `docs/` are tracked; reference the
  env var or `.credentials/` filename, never the value
- **Inbound webhook signatures are verified before the payload is read**, on every
  delivery path — an unsigned or unknown sender is rejected, not parsed
- **bash scripts must use `set -euo pipefail`** and `$()` not backticks
- **All Docker images pin tags** (no `:latest` for non-upstream images)

### 4. Verification

After any change:

```bash
# Build and start (adapt to your stack)
docker compose build && docker compose up -d

# Check health
docker compose ps

# Run tests (add --with-e2e once the container is up)
bash tests/run.sh --with-e2e

# No secrets in git diff
git diff --cached | grep -iE '(api_key|secret|token|password)' || echo "Clean"
```

### 5. PRD → Test → CI Pattern (mandatory for all PRDs)

Every PRD in `docs/prd/` must follow this structure for its Success Criteria section:

1. **Success Criteria as annotated bullets** — each SC is a bullet with an inline `_Verify:` annotation pointing to the specific test file + test ID:
   ```
   - **SC1** — <criterion>. _Verify:_ `tests/unit/example.test.ts` (AC-EXM-001).
   ```

2. **Test Mapping table** — after the SC bullets, a table mapping expected behavior → test file → test IDs:
   ```
   | Expected behavior | Test file | Test IDs |
   |---|---|---|
   | Example behavior | example.test.ts | AC-EXM-001 |
   ```

3. **CI/CD Gate section** — explicit statement of which CI job(s) run the tests:
   ```
   ## CI/CD Gate
   All tests run in CI per .github/workflows/ci.yml. No PR merges with a red test.
   ```

**Test ID convention:** `AC-<DOMAIN>-NNN`. Domain prefixes match the PRD topic, and the
hundreds digit encodes the tier:

| Range | Tier | Directory |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `AC-X-0NN` | Unit | `tests/unit/` |
| `AC-X-1NN` | E2E | `tests/e2e/` |
| `AC-X-2NN` | Integration | `tests/integration/` |

**Three-tier test suite:** Every SC maps to one of three tiers, and every tier is
actually executed by `tests/run.sh` and by a CI job — a tier with no runner is a defect:
- Unit + Component — `tests/unit/` (pure logic, no transport)
- E2E — `tests/e2e/` (bats, against a running container)
- Integration — `tests/integration/` (cross-process / persistence)

**A test that writes to shared infrastructure is opt-in.** If the integration tier
talks to a real broker, a shared database, or any stack another team also uses, it
must not run by default: set `INTEGRATION_NEEDS_OPT_IN=1` in `tests/run.sh`, and the
tier then only runs with `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` in the environment. Default-on is
correct only while every integration test is hermetic. This is the same hazard as the
`act push` warning in §6 — a local verification run that mutates live state.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline — Local-First, Then Remote

```
Stage 1: LOCAL CI                Stage 2: REMOTE CI (Git repo)
─────────────────────            ──────────────────────────────
nektos/act                       GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/)
runs .github/workflows/*.yml     triggers on PR
locally via Docker               all jobs must pass
                                  blocks merge on red
        ↓                               ↓
  green → open PR  ──────→  PR CI runs  ──────→  green → merge
```

**Rule: no PR is opened with a known-red local CI run.**

> **Do not run `act push` unqualified, or `act push -j e2e`, on a host that also runs a
> live deployment of this compose project.** The compose project name derives from the
> directory name, so the E2E job's `docker compose up -d --build` **replaces the running
> containers**. The job also tends not to pass under `act`: compose talks to the host
> daemon while act's steps run inside a container, so anything the workflow seeds on
> disk lands where the bind mount does not resolve. Locally run
> `act push -j unit`, `-j integration`, `-j secret-scan`, `-j doctrine`, and exercise the E2E tier
> directly with `docker compose up -d --build && bash tests/run.sh --with-e2e` from a
> checkout that is not the deployment.

Two workflows gate this repo:

| Workflow | Gates |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | unit → integration → e2e (Docker), plus a secret scan and the `doctrine` job |
| `.github/workflows/sources-readonly.yml` | `kb/raw/**` is add-only; edits need the `ingest` label (funnel rule 3) |

The `doctrine` job is the structural half of the Harness Adapter: it fails the build if
a harness entry point is a plain copy or a dangling symlink, or if a `.gitignore` rule
hides a funnel stage (rules 9–10). Both are silent failures otherwise — a forked
`CLAUDE.md` drifts from `AGENTS.md` with nothing to notice it, and a `.claude/skills`
symlink pointing at an absent `.agents/` is committed and cloned intact.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start services (adapt to your stack)
docker compose up -d

# Tests (unit + integration; add --with-e2e against a running container)
bash tests/run.sh
bash tests/run.sh --with-e2e

# Local CI (pre-PR) — never `act push` unqualified on a deployment host; see §6
act push -j unit && act push -j integration && act push -j secret-scan && act push -j doctrine
```

## Security

- Never commit `.env`, API keys, or JWT secrets — only `.example` shapes are tracked
- All credentials via env vars or `.credentials/` (gitignored), never hardcoded
- Never paste a live value into `kb/` or `docs/` — see funnel rule 9. `kb/raw/` is
  add-only, so a leak there is unfixable by edit
- Every inbound webhook delivery is signature-verified before its payload is read; a
  sender with no stored secret is rejected, not parsed
- Signing secrets are keyed per sender, so one sender's secret cannot sign another's
  deliveries
- `secret-scan` in CI enforces the first two structurally

## graphify

When `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, use graphify for codebase queries:

```bash
graphify query "<question>"
graphify path "<A>" "<B>"
graphify explain "<concept>"
```

After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current.
